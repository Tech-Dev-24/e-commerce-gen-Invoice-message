Educational PHP/MySQL e-commerce demo — user/admin auth, product catalog, and simple ordering. Mini Project

This repository hosts an educational e-commerce demo built using PHP, MySQL (XAMPP), HTML, and CSS. It features both user and admin authentication, a product catalog with images, and a one-click order system that instantly generates an invoice and updates the shipping tracking status. The admin panel allows viewing users, managing products, checking orders, and tracking shipments.

The project is designed purely for learning and practice — helping students understand how backend logic, database relations, and basic e-commerce workflows function in PHP and MySQL.
